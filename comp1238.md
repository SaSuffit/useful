## Lectures and past to now
## Week 1 - History
- One writing system can be used by many languages
- Cuneiform looks weird
- The Epic of Gilgamesh was epic

## Week 2 - Bits and Bytes
- Bits are used arbitrarily for characters, Morse Code could have worked well too but it’s all dashes.<br>
Inconvenient for engineering, they chose Binary (1/0) for digits (off/on)
- Defining Memory:<br>
Vola- = To fly away (pun for data loss)<br>
Non-Vola = Stays in one place<br>
Volatile Memory = FAST //Lose data (RAM)<br>
Non-Volatile = Large/Cheap

## Week 3 - Online UI-Displays and character usage
- ASCII was used to base UTF-8 and has Binary results from previous use too
- If UTF-8 has Full Byte of 0's, it would end transmission immediately, the padding of changing the Full Byte of 0's was changed to continue the HTML/UTF-8

## Week 4 - Languages online
- Newer Languages:<br>
XML - eXtensible Markup Language
<br>
JSON -> newer and taking over but XML still has a foothold
- IBM Model M:<br>
Original Standard model, requires adapter nowadays<br>
MOST keyboards are derived from this design

## Week 5 - Inside the Keyboard
- Keycap
- Upper case <br> 
    ○ Contains the slider guide that moves up and down with the key press
- Rubber domes <br>
    ○ Formed rubber sheet of 0.6mm thick <br>
    ○ Top membrane layer <br>
Traces and contact pads on lower surface<br>
- Centre Membrane Layer<br>
Top layer is pressed through the holes in centre layer<br>
- Bottom layer<br>
Traces and contacts on upper surface layer<br>
- Lower case<br>
Supports the membrane on upper surface<br>
- Repedative Strain Injury:<br>
Most musicians gave way to RSI such as Piano players having the same posture day in and day out causing a minute problem that becomes a larger issue without it being addressed
