## Week 1 - History
- One writing system can be used by many languages
- Cuneiform looks weird
- The Epic of Gilgamesh was epic
## Week 2 - Bits and Bytes
- Bits are used arbitrarily for characters, Morse Code could have worked well too but it’s all dashes.
Inconvenient for engineering, they chose Binary (1/0) for digits (off/on)
- Defining Memory:
* Vola- = To fly away (pun for data loss)
* Non-Vola = Stays in one place
* Volatile Memory = FAST //Lose data (RAM)
* Non-Volatile = Large/Cheap
## Week 3 - Online UI-Displays and character usage
- ASCII was used to base UTF-8 and has Binary results from previous use too
- If UTF-8 has Full Byte of 0's, it would end transmission immediately, the padding of changing the Full Byte of 0's was changed to continue the HTML/UTF-8
## Week 4 - Languages online
- Newer Languages:
XML - eXtensible Markup Language
JSON -> newer and taking over but XML still has a foothold
- IBM Model M: 
Original Standard model, requires adapter nowadays
MOST keyboards are derived from this design
## Week 5 - Inside the Keyboard
- Keycap
- Upper case 
    ○ Contains the slider guide that moves up and down with the key press
- Rubber domes
    ○ Formed rubber sheet of 0.6mm thick
    ○ Top membrane layer
Traces and contact pads on lower surface
- Centre Membrane Layer
Top layer is pressed through the holes in centre layer
- Bottom layer
Traces and contacts on upper surface layer
- Lower case
Supports the membrane on upper surface
- Repedative Strain Injury:
Most musicians gave way to RSI such as Piano players having the same posture day in and day out causing a minute problem that becomes a larger issue without it being addressed
